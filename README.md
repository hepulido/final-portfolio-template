## Portfolio Introduction
My name is Hector Pulido, and I am a passionate software developer with a deep interest in creating innovative solutions using cutting-edge technologies. I specialize in back-end development, full-stack development, and AI integration. Over the years, I've honed my skills in building scalable systems, crafting efficient APIs, and developing AI-driven applications that add real value to users.

I do what I do because I am driven by the endless potential technology offers to improve lives and streamline business operations. My focus is on solving real-world problems through automation, AI, and software solutions. I am particularly motivated by the ability to create tools and platforms that empower businesses to operate more efficiently and effectively.

I have had the privilege of working with diverse teams at Multiverse and within American Express, particularly on the Global Disclosure platform. At American Express, I have contributed to back-end development. I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to build reliable, scalable, and performance-driven systems.

I have a strong passion for back-end development and AI technologies. Specifically, I enjoy working with Java, Spring Boot, and Node.js to build powerful back-end systems. My interest in AI development is focused on creating intelligent systems that enhance automation and data processing, especially through machine learning and NLP. I am also passionate about building user-centered applications with full-stack frameworks like React and Vue.
