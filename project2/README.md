https://github.com/Back-end-Project/Bank-Project

High-Level Overview
Project Purpose
The Bank Project is a web application designed to simulate banking operations, allowing users to manage their accounts, view transactions, and perform basic banking functions such as deposits and withdrawals.

Users
The primary users are individuals seeking a user-friendly platform to manage their banking activities, including checking balances, transferring funds, and viewing transaction history.

Job Formation
The application provides users with the ability to perform essential banking tasks efficiently, reducing the need for physical bank visits and streamlining financial management.

Inspiration
The inspiration behind the Bank Project came from the increasing demand for digital banking solutions and the desire to create a simple yet effective tool that mimics real banking functionalities for educational purposes.

Important Features
Account Management: Users can create, view, and manage their bank accounts.
Transaction History: A feature that allows users to view their transaction history.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Users can perform deposit and withdrawal transactions.
Fund Transfer: Enables users to transfer funds between accounts.
STAR Interview Questions
Situation
The application was created to provide a practical solution for users to manage their banking needs digitally while simulating the functionalities of a real bank.

Task
The overall structure of the application includes a back-end built with Spring Boot, managing user accounts and transactions through a RESTful API. The design process involved outlining user requirements and defining the database schema.

Action
The code consists of Spring Boot components for handling API requests, security configurations for user authentication, and database interactions using JPA with PostgreSQL. I implemented error handling and validation to ensure data integrity.

Result
The final application successfully allows users to perform various banking operations, with a secure and responsive interface. Screenshots illustrate the user interface and demonstrate the application's functionalities.

Competencies
Web Development
Full Text: Develop and maintain web applications.

Situation
During the development of the Bank Project, I was responsible for building a back-end that simulates banking functionalities for users.

Actions
I utilized Spring Boot for server-side development, focusing on creating RESTful API endpoints for various banking operations. I implemented user authentication and ensured secure access to sensitive data.

Results
The application was successfully deployed and provided users with a secure and functional banking simulation. This project enhanced my skills in web development, particularly in building robust back-end systems.

Connection to Project
This competency relates to my role in the Bank Project, where I applied web development principles to create a functional and secure banking application.

Database Management
Full Text: Design and maintain databases to support application functionality.

Situation
In the Bank Project, I was tasked with designing the database schema to support user accounts and transaction records.

Actions
I defined the database schema for users and transactions, ensuring proper relationships and data integrity. I implemented CRUD operations to manage user data and transactions effectively.

Results
The well-structured database allowed for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, resulting in a smooth user experience. This project deepened my understanding of database management and its critical role in application functionality.

Connection to Project
This competency is closely tied to my work on the Bank Project, as I was responsible for ensuring that the database effectively supported the application's requirements.
